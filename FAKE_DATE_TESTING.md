# Fake Date Testing with MMM-MyScoreboard

This module now supports the `useFakeDate` option for testing purposes, allowing you to simulate any date without changing your system clock.

## Configuration

Add the `useFakeDate` option to your module configuration:

```javascript
{
  module: 'MMM-MyScoreboard',
  position: 'top_right',
  config: {
    useFakeDate: '2024-02-11', // Simulate this date (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
    sports: [
      {
        league: 'NFL',
        teams: ['KC', 'NE']
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Date Override**: When `useFakeDate` is set, the module behaves as if the current date is the specified date
2. **Time Calculations**: All rollover logic, API calls, and date-based decisions use the fake date
3. **Debug Hours/Minutes**: The existing `debugHours` and `debugMinutes` options still work and are applied on top of the fake date
4. **Backward Compatibility**: The old `DEBUG_gameDate` option still works and takes precedence over `useFakeDate`

## Examples

### Test Super Bowl Sunday 2024
```javascript
useFakeDate: '2024-02-11', // Super Bowl LVIII date
```

### Test NFL Season Start
```javascript
useFakeDate: '2024-09-05', // Week 1 NFL 2024
```

### Test Off-Season (No Games)
```javascript
useFakeDate: '2024-06-15', // Middle of NFL off-season
```

### Test with Time Adjustments
```javascript
useFakeDate: '2024-02-11',
debugHours: 3, // Simulate 3 hours later in the day
```

## API Impact

- The fake date is used for all ESPN API calls
- Each league still makes separate API calls per the normal schedule
- No additional API load is generated by the fake date feature

## Testing Scenarios

This feature is perfect for testing:

1. **Bye Week Behavior**: Set date during NFL bye weeks to test fallback content
2. **Off-Season Handling**: Test how the module behaves when no games are scheduled
3. **Rollover Logic**: Test the `rolloverHours` behavior at different times
4. **Multi-League**: Test different sports seasons overlapping
5. **Game Day Experience**: Test how live games appear and update

## Production Use

- Set `useFakeDate: null` or remove the option entirely for production
- The module will use real current date/time when this option is not set
- No performance impact when the option is disabled
